# Artificial Intelligence (COMP30024) 2022 Semester 1 Assignment 2

# Project:
Given an already populated Cachex board (Hexagonal grid) of arbitrary size n, along with a start coordinate and
a goal coordinate, find the lowest cost path from the start coordinate to the goal coordinate,
while avoiding already-occupied cells. 

# Implementation:
- use A* search with an admissible heuristic to optimise its performance
